        <h1 class="text-3xl">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3">
          DOM is document object model.An XML or HTML document is treated as a
          tree structure with each node representing a different part of the
          document by the cross-platform and language-independent Document
          Object Model interface. A document is represented by a logical tree in
          the DOM.

          2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3">
          JavaScript's DOM Selectors are used to choose specific HTML elements
          from a document. Here are the name of DOM methods: getElementById(),
          getElementsByClassName(),getElementsByName(), getElementsByTagName(),
          querySelector(),querySelectorAll().

        <h1 class="text-3xl">3.What is event bubble?</h1>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3">
          Event bubbling is a type of DOM event propagation where the event
          starts by triggering on the innermost target element and then
          continues by triggering on the target element's ancestors until it
          reaches the outermost DOM element or document object.

          4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl mt-3">
          A callback function is a function that receives an argument from
          another function and is subsequently called from inside the outer
          function to finish a task or activity. The aforementioned illustration
          is a synchronous callback because it is executed right away.
